# Variables
Bash documentation uses the term "Parameters" and considers "variables" a type of "parameter".

## Parameters
A Parameter is a named space in memory you can use to retrieve or store information.
Most programming languages call this a variable.

Bash parameters come in two flavors:

- **variables** - parameters that you can create and/or update yourself
- **special parameters** - read-only, pre-set by BASH, and used to communicate some type of internal status.

## Variables
Variable names must consist only of **letters, digits and underscores, and cannot begin with a digit.**
The name can be long, there are no limits imposed by Bash, but there are limits imposed by the kernel. Any
reasonable length is fine.

To store (assign) data in a variable, use the following syntax:
```bash
var=foo
    
# This is wrong!
var = foo
# Bash attempts to run a command named "var" with 2 arguments: "=" and "foo"

# This is also wrong!
$var=foo
# Bash is not Perl or PHP. The $ symbol means "the value of".
# Use the "bare" name in assignments.
```
Here are a few examples of **Variables** that the shell provides for you:

- **BASH_VERSION**: Contains a string describing the version of Bash.
- **HOSTNAME**: Contains the hostname of your computer. Either short or long form, depending on how your computer is set up.
- **PPID**: Contains the PID of the parent process of this shell.
- **PWD**: Contains the current working directory.
- **RANDOM**: Each time you expand this variable, a (pseudo)random number between 0 and 32767 is generated.
- **UID**: The ID number of the current user. Not reliable for security/authentication purposes, alas.
- **COLUMNS**: The width of your terminal in characters. does not work reliably within a script. Use `$(tput cols)` in scripts.
- **LINES**: The height of your terminal in characters.  does not work reliably within a script. Use `$(tput lines)` in scripts.
- **HOME**: The current user's home directory.
- **PATH**: A colon-separated list of paths that will be searched to find a command
- **PS1**: Contains a string that describes the format of your shell prompt.
- **TMPDIR**: Contains the directory that is used to store temporary files

(There are many more -- see the manual for a comprehensive list.)

## Special Parameters
These are read-only parameters generated by Bash itself. They use numbers and other characters that you can't use in "variables".

| Parameter Name | Usage       | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`            | `"$0"`      | Contains the name, or the path, of the script. This is not always reliable.                                                     |
| `1 2 etc.`     | `"$1"` etc. | *Positional Parameters*, arguments passed to the current script or function. Parameters greater than 9 need braces, ie. `${12}` |
| `*`            | `"$*"`      | all positional parameters. If Double quoted, expands to a single string separated by first character of the **IFS** variable.   |
| `@`            | `"$@"`      | all positional parameters. If Double quoted, expands to a list of them all as individual words.                                 |
| `#`            | `$#`        | the number of positional parameters that are currently set.                                                                     |
| `?`            | `$?`        | the exit code of the most recently completed foreground command.                                                                |
| `$`            | `$$`        | the PID (process ID number) of the current shell.                                                                               |
| `!`            | `$!`        | the PID of the command most recently executed in the background.                                                                |
| `_`            | `"$_"`      | the last argument of the last command that was executed.                                                                        |

## Variable Types
Bash is an "untyped" language, all variables are stored as strings and handled according to context when they are used.
If a string contains a number, it will be treated as one if you use it in a "arithmetic context" i.e. increment, add, subtract, etc.

- **Array**: `declare -a foo`: an array of strings.
- **Associative array**: `declare -A foo`: an associative array of strings (bash 4.0 +)
- **Integer**: `declare -i foo`: an integer, automatically triggers Arithmetic Evaluation.
- **Read Only**: `declare -r foo`: The variable can no longer be modified or unset. Same as `readonly foo`
- **Export**: `declare -x foo`: variable will be inherited by any child process.

Arrays are very convenient for their ability to store multiple strings together without relying on
a *delimiter* to split them apart (which is tedious when done correctly and error-prone when not).

Defining variables as integers has the advantage that you can leave out some syntax when trying to assign or modify them:

```bash
# Without declaring as integer, concatenates the string.
a=5; a+=2; echo $a; unset a
52

# Without declaring as integer, using explicit numeric command.
a=5; let a+=2; echo $a; unset a
7

# Declare as integer, works as expected
declare -i a=5; a+=2; echo $a; unset a
7

# Regular declaration, treats the expression as a string
a=5+2; echo $a; unset a
5+2

# Declare as integer, treats expression as numeric expression
declare -i a=5+2; echo $a; unset a
7
```

However, in practice the use of `declare -i` is rare.
Most shell scripters prefer to use explicit arithmetic commands i.e. `let` or `((...))` when they want to perform arithmetic.

It is also rare to see an explicit declaration of an array using `declare -a`.
It is sufficient to write `array=(...)` and Bash will know that the variable is now an array.
The exception to this is the associative array, which *must* be declared explicitly: `declare -A myarray`.
